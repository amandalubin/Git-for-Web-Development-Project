    1. What is Semantic HTML? 
        Semantic HTML provides meaning to your content. Using semantic HTML tags (e.g., header, footer, section, p) can help other developers understand what the content is for. Using semantic HTML properly can also help with SEO. 
    2. What is HTML used for? 
        HTML is a markup language used to provide structure to your content. There are two types of HTML: semantic and presentational. 
    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? 
        Attributes provide additional information about an element. For example, the attribute associated with <img> is src (source). The attribute goes after the tag. For example, <img src="URL HERE">.
    4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page?
        h1 is a HTML heading tag. There are 6 heading tags, h1-h6, and h1 has the largest text. You should only use h1 once, as this is meant to denote the most important heading on the page. 
    5. Name two tags that have required attributes
        The image tag <img> is associated with the src attribute (the url of the image source). The anchor tag <a> is associated with the href attribute (the link's destination).
    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? 
        You can't see what you put in the head on the page, so you only want to put reference information that you don't expect to see on your page. For example, you can link external files like CSS in the head.
    7. What is an id? 
        You can add an ID to an HTML element in order to identify it. This is used so that in CSS you can add specific styles to the element with that ID. A unique ID is used for one specific element (vs a class which can be used to add styles to multiple elements)
    8. What elements can I add an id to? 
        You can add an ID to any HTML element. 
    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 
        Only once. 
    10. What is a class? 
        You can add a class to multiple HTML elements in order to apply the same styles to all elements with that class. For example, you might have three different divs that you want to style in the same way. To do this, you can add a class to those three divs in HTML, and then define the styles for that class in HTML. 
    11. What elements can I add a class to?
        You can add a class to any element.  
    12. How many times can I use the same class on a page?
        Multiple times.  
    13. How do I get my link to open in a new tab?
        You would add target="_blank" after the href in HTML. For example: <a href="url here" target="_blank">link here</a>
    14. What is the alt attribute used for? 
        The alt attribute is used for images. It allows you to provide a description of the image in case the user cannot view the image. 
    15. How do I reference an id?
        #id{
            property:value;
        }
    16. What is the difference between a section and a div?
        A section is semantic HMTL. It is a grouping of content on the page. A div is presentational HTML. It is a generic container used for grouping HTML elements together, so that you can manipulate those groups together in CSS. A div does not have any meaning related to the content of the page. 
    17. What is CSS used for? 
        CSS is Cascading Style Sheets. CSS enables you to display HTML in different ways. For example, you can use CSS to change the colors, fonts, backgrounds, etc. for HTML content. 
    18. How to we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page
        h2{
            property:value;
        }
    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one
        An ID is unique; it is used for one specific element (vs a class which can be used to describe multiple elements). Let's say you have 5 different paragraphs on the page and you want to color paragraphs 1-4 blue. You could assign a class to paragraphs 1-4 in HTML, and then write a rule in CSS that colors that class blue. Now let's say you decide that paragraph 3 should have a background color of pink (and the others were white). You can assign an ID to paragraph 3 and write a rule in CSS that specifies that the background color for that ID is pink. This would apply the pink background to that single paragraph. 
    20. How do we select classes in CSS? 
        .class{
            property:value;
        }
    21. How do we select a p element with a single class of “human””?
        p.human{
            property:value;   
        }
    22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful?
        A parent child selector enables you to select all child elements associated with a specific parent element. For example, this would be useful is you wanted to select all p elements within a specific parent div. 
    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar?
        ****REVIEW THIS ONE******
        div.sidebar a:link, div.sidebar a:visited{
            property:value;
        }
    24. What is a pseudo selector?
        Pseudo selectors are used to style elements in a certain state. For example, a common use of pseudo selectors is to style elements differently when a mouse hovers over those elements on the page. 
    25. What do we use the change the spacing between lines?
        The property is line-height. 
    26. What do we use to change the spacing between letters?
        The property is line-height. For the value, you can use a number or percentage. 
    27. What do we use to to change everything to CAPITALS? lowercase? Capitalize?
        CAPITALS: text-transform: uppercase;
        lowercase: text-transform: lowercase;
        Capitalize: text-transform: capitalize;
    28. How do I add a 1px border around my div that is dotted and black?
        div{
            border: 1px dotted black;
        }
    29. How do I select everything on the page?
        Use the universal selector (also called the wildcard selector). 
        *{
            property:value; 
        }
    30. How do I write a comment in CSS?
        Start with /* and end with */
    31. How do I find out what file I am in, when I am using the command line?
        **NOT SURE ABOUT THIS ONE!**
        You can use cd .. to see what the directory above the one you're currently in, and then reenter the directory you want to be in using cd + the file name. 
    32. Using the command line - how do I see a list of files/folders in my current folder?
        Use the command ls
    33. How do I remove a file via the command line? Why do I have to be careful with this? 
        Use the command rm + the file name. You have to be careful because there is no warning before the file is removed, and removing a file via the terminal is irreversible. 
    34. Why should I use version control?
        Version control is important because it allows you to save multiple versions of your code. If you try something new and the code breaks, you can always go back to a previous version. Version control is especially important when multiple developers are working on the same code base, since this enables developers to see changes made by others in an organized way. 
    35. How often should I commit to github?
        Frequently! Brit Hemming recommended every 20 minutes. 
    36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github? 
        git push 
    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow.
        1. Create OWN version of Repo (Fork)
        2. Add TL as a collaborator
        3. Clone Repo
        4. Create a branch using git checkout -b 'firstName-lastName'
        5. Submit PR into the new branch and add their TL as a reviewer on the PR

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? 
        Inline elements like <span> can be nested inside of other elements without disrupting the flow of content. Block elements cannot be nested inside other elements without interupting the flow of the content. Each block element would be shown on a new line. 
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
        When an element is positioned absolutely, it is only positioned relative to the nearest positioned parent. 
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        Block: p, header, section
        Inline: span, a
        Inline-block: don't know
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
        The box model is a way of interpreting the HTML elements on a page as a set of different boxes. Each box can have margin, border, padding and content. Together, these different boxes make up a web page. Visualizing the HTML elements as a set of boxes is helpful when styling in CSS.
